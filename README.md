# Credit card checker
This program does the following things:
1. Determines if a credit card number is valid or invalid
2. Loops through a batch of credit card numbers and returns a new batch containing all the invalid credit card numbers
3. Identifies the companies that issued invalid credit cards, and notes the invalid cards with un-identified issuers.
4. Converts invalid credit card numbers to valid credit card numbers
5. Tests all of these functions with provided valid and invalid credit card numbers.
